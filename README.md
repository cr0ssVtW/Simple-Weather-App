# Simple Weather App (PHP) w/ Dark Sky API
A simple weather application utilizing the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) and Google Geocode.

The app is in a very rough draft state, but fully functional. Also allows multiple requests concurrently via curl_multi_exec. 

Plug in your Dark Sky API Key (required) and Google API Key (not required) and check the index.php to see it in action.
